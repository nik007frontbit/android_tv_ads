# Android TV Ads

A Flutter project designed to run on Android TV, showcasing how to implement ad handling with a focus on remote control-based navigation.

## Project Overview

This project is a starting point for building a Flutter application with Android TV integration. The focus is on enabling smooth remote control interactions, handling sliding ads, and managing ad displays on the Android TV interface.

Key features include:
- **Remote Control-Based Focus Navigation**: Manage focus navigation across UI elements with support for Android TV remote.
- **Ad Handling**: Display and interact with a dynamic list of ads, including tracking and controlling the time spent on each ad.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install Flutter on your machine if you haven’t already: [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Set up Android Studio and the Android Emulator, or use a physical Android TV device.
- Ensure the `flutter` and `dart` commands are in your PATH.

### Running the Project Locally

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/android_tv_ads.git
    cd android_tv_ads
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Build the App**:
    Build the app for Android using Flutter:
    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```

4. **Serve the APK Locally**:
    After building the app, navigate to the output folder and serve it:
    ```bash
    cd build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
    serve
    ```

5. **Use ngrok to Make the APK Accessible Online**:
    In a new terminal tab, run ngrok to expose the local server:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```

6. **Access the APK on Android TV**:
    - Open the **Downloader** app on your Android TV (you can download it from the Google Play Store).
    - Enable installation from **Unknown Sources** in Android TV Settings:
        - Go to **Settings > Apps > Security & Restrictions**.
        - Disable **Verify apps** and allow **Unknown sources** for the **Downloader** app.
    - Enter the ngrok URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://b3cdd4f102eb.ngrok.io/app-release.apk`) into the Downloader app.
    - Download and install the APK on your Android TV.

7. **Run the App**:
    After installation, open the app and start navigating through the UI using the Android TV remote. Test ad functionality, sliding, and interaction through remote control focus.

## Focus Navigation with Remote Control

In this app, focus navigation is managed by handling remote key events. Flutter’s `FocusNode` and `FocusScope` are used to track and update the currently focused widget. The app provides seamless navigation across text fields, buttons, and interactive elements using the Android TV remote.

### Key Remote Actions:
- **D-pad navigation**: Use the D-pad (directional pad) to move between items.
- **Enter/Select button**: Press the "OK" button to select an item or interact with content.
- **Back button**: Navigate to the previous screen or close the app.

## Ad Handling

The app manages a dynamic list of ads that can be displayed and interacted with using the remote control. You can configure ad durations, time measurement, and track the user’s interaction with ads for analytics purposes.

### Key Features:
- **Ad Sliding**: Ads are displayed in a carousel or sliding format, with smooth transitions.
- **Ad Time Measurement**: Track the time spent on each ad, and send this data to an API for analytics.
- **API Integration**: The app sends data regarding ad views and interactions to a backend server via API calls.

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue with Remote Control Focus**: If focus navigation is not working correctly, ensure that your focus nodes are properly set up and the `FocusScope` is correctly managing the focus.
- **Ad Not Displaying**: Check if the ad data is being fetched correctly from the server. Ensure the correct layout and widget are being used to display the ads.
- **APK Not Installing**: Ensure that you’ve allowed installation from unknown sources in the Android TV settings and that the APK is properly served via the ngrok URL.
